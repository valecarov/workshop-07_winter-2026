Week 7 workshop: linear models

This is a README! It tells you what is in the GitHub repo.

All READMEs for this class should have the following sections:

## General information

What is this repo for?

This repository contains two examples for running linear models 

Whose repo is it? Who is contributing to it?

This is my personal repo forked from the ENVS-193DS Organization

## Data and file information

What files are there?

all code files are in the 'code' folder. These are .qmd files that contain models for abalone pH ('abalone-example.qmd') and temperature elevation ('sonadora-temperature-example.qmd')

What code is there, and what does it do?

Both files include code for creating linear models, checking model diagnostics, creating predictions and visualizing predictions.
